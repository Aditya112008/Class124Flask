All API's use an http method 
GET is one method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource 
When you access a websites page your browser makes a GET request to your API (any API) 
and API returns the front end that is displayed in the browser screen 


All the API's that we create in flask by default use GET request 
If we start our hello_world server and go to localhost: 5000, 
we can see in the terminal that the browser made a GET request on the server/API

Post Method is used to send data to the server to create/ update a resource

Put Method is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource
